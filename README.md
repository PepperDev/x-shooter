X-Shooter
=========

A First Person Shooter 2D game, just for fun.

Compiling
---------

First you need SDL dev packages, on Debian based linux (such as Ubuntu) you can follow these commands:

	# apt-get install -y libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Then, for compiling you simple do:

	$ make

So, if everything goes well the binary file will appear in the current folder, follow the command to play:

	$ ./x-shooter
